# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-In-Python

The Tic-Tac-Toe Project is a simple implementation of the classic two-player game, Tic-Tac-Toe, using Python. The project is designed to provide an interactive, console-based gaming experience where two players can take turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until one player wins by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, or until all cells are filled resulting in a draw.
